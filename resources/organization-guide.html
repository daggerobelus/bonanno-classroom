    <p>Strategies for staying organized and managing your time throughout the semester.</p>

    <p class="guide-intro">Time management becomes a lot easier when you have a system in place that you can use and revise as your needs change. It can be challenging to come up with that system, and it does require some trial and error. Here are some different tools and strategies that you might consider using if you've found yourself feeling overwhelmed or disorganized or wanting more structure.</p>

        <h2>Be Your Own Scheduling Assistant</h2>

        <h3>Using a Daily/Weekly Planner</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of the semester, look at all your syllabi and put all your assignments into your planner on the due date. It's time consuming up front, but there are a lot of benefits. You can see at a glance how much work you have to do for a given day — some days you might have a lot, and other days very little. You can also add things to each day as they arise, such as an application for a summer internship or an email you want to send (or even your laundry!).</p>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p>Try to get into the habit of planning out your days or weeks the night before. Lay out any "set" things — classes, extracurricular meetings, etc. — in your planner and, based on that, block out times for work, eating, fun, etc.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Using a Monthly Planner</h3>
        <p>Most daily/weekly planners will also have monthly calendars. For each month, you can put the due dates of your major assignments. You might realize that you have a lot to do in a particular week, and you can plan accordingly. If you also have a special occasion or personal event, mark that on your calendar so you can see how you'll have to manage your work. If you're not into a physical, paper planner, try a whiteboard monthly calendar that you can fill in at the beginning of each month.</p>

        <h3>Using a Digital Calendar</h3>
        <p>Keep track of your classes, appointments, lectures, social events, etc. on a digital calendar like Google Calendar. It's especially helpful for when you have irregularities in your schedule, such as a guest lecture or a study session.</p>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p>Color-code your calendar. I highly recommend making your social things a different color so you can see at a glance if you're balancing school and a social life. If you don't see that color one week, you know you should make plans to see a friend.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Not All Hours Are Equal</h3>
        <p>Be conscientious about what times of day your brain is most alert and schedule "hard" tasks for that time. If you don't work well late at night, save your paper writing and major studying for the morning or afternoon when you feel like you're at your best.</p>

        <h3>Some Other Strategies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Print out copies of your syllabi and use them as a checklist for each class' assignments.</li>
            <li>Work backwards from the due date. If you know it takes you X number of days to write a paper, mark the date that you need to start in your planner. Don't know how long something might take? Put two reminders in your planner: one on the actual due date and another a week before.</li>
            <li>The app <strong>Streaks</strong> can help you build daily habits, like reviewing material 30 minutes per day, or more intermittent habits, like regular Brightspace postings. People also use it for self-care and health habits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Kicking Procrastination's Butt</h2>

        <h3>The Pomodoro Technique</h3>
        <p>The Pomodoro Technique is all about doing your work in smaller chunks and taking breaks. You might consider setting a timer for 25-30 minutes and trying to complete a task (or part of the task) during that time. Once the time is up, take a break. For most people, it's easier to get work done in discrete 30-minute chunks with a particular goal.</p>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p>Using a timer sounds like too much work? The app <strong>Focus Keeper</strong> does all of the work for you and can help you master the Pomodoro Technique.</p>

    <div class="guide-section">
        <hr class="hairline">
        <h2>The Power of Friendship</h2>

        <h3>Accountability Deadlines</h3>
        <p>It can be easier to produce work if you know you have to show it to someone else, like when your paper deadline is in 48 hours and you have to turn something in. You can create "deadlines" for yourself where you and a friend or classmate will exchange drafts, work on a problem set, or make a portion of a study guide. You get the benefit of collaboration and getting your work done. When we self-impose deadlines, following through can be tricky. When we set deadlines with friends, we add a layer of accountability.</p>

        <h3>Study Groups</h3>
        <p>Set up study groups! You can meet in person or virtually where the goal is to work on a particular assignment — or just work in general — with a group of people. School work doesn't have to be a solitary activity.</p>

        <h3>Writing Every Day</h3>
        <p>While it may seem like you can write the most by dedicating hours and hours to your essay in a single day, a study by Robert Boice shows that writers are most successful and produce the most pages when they write every day in smaller chunks of time. So, instead of spending an entire Sunday writing your paper, you might find it more useful to work on your paper for 30-60 minutes each day.</p>

        <h2>Self-Care (It's Important)</h2>

        <p>We all know that self-care matters, but it's often one of the first things that gets put to the side when the semester gets busy and stressful. Establishing self-care practices <em>before</em> your workload piles up can help ensure that it becomes part of your routine. This can be as simple as having a normal sleep schedule (I know, easier said than done), meditating, or scheduling a weekly chat with a friend from home.</p>
        <p>Organization and time management strategies can themselves be a form of self-care, but doing things outside of schoolwork — like watching YouTube or listening to a podcast or binging a bad reality TV show — are also important. Take care of yourself so you can do your best work.</p>
