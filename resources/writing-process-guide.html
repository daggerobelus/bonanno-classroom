    <p>Potential goals for each stage of the writing process — from first brainstorm to final polish.</p>
</header>

<!-- Body -->
<main class="guide-body">

    <p class="guide-intro">The writing process is more than just "open a document and start writing." Breaking it into stages — each with its own goals — can help demystify the process and make it feel more manageable. The goals below aren't a prescriptive checklist. They're suggestions you <em>could</em> incorporate into your writing process depending on where you are and what you need.</p>

    <!-- Section 1: Prewriting -->
    <div class="guide-section">
        <hr class="hairline">
        <h2>Prewriting &amp; Brainstorming</h2>

        <h3>Read and Interpret the Prompt</h3>
        <p>Prompts require interpretation so you know the task that's being asked of you. Try reading and annotating a prompt the way you would a text — marking the actions it asks for. Are you asked to close read? Analyze an argument? Defend a position? Figuring out what's being asked can help you figure out where to start and whether you have any questions.</p>

        <h3>Choose Some Evidence</h3>
        <p>Once you've interpreted the prompt, it can be useful to turn to your evidence, since the evidence available to you will dictate the scope and direction of your paper. For a close-reading paper, picking passages that speak to you on some level is a good way to start. It's even better if you can pick a passage that raises more questions for you than it answers. Try typing all of your potential evidence into one document so you have a list of quotations to work with.</p>

        <h3>Free Write</h3>
        <p>Free writing can be a great way to get a bunch of words on the page. During a free write, you don't worry about anyone else reading your ideas — or even having good ideas. A free write gives you a chance to work through your thoughts in writing. Writing itself is an act of cognition — a way of thinking — so you might write your way to a main claim or specific idea.</p>

        <h3>Outline Your Thoughts</h3>
        <p>Outlining — whether in a bullet-point list or a more free-form mind map — can be a nice alternative to free writing if just sitting down to write in an informal and messy way seems intimidating. An outline can give you a sense of direction to kick-start the drafting process.</p>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p>An outline is just a plan. It's important to be flexible and deviate from the plan when you discover something new about your idea — which essentially will always happen.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2: First Draft -->
    <div class="guide-section">
        <hr class="hairline">
        <h2>First Draft</h2>

        <h3>Break Up Your Writing</h3>
        <p>Managing your writing in smaller chunks can help make the process less overwhelming. The task of writing one paragraph can feel easier than the task of writing four pages. Think about how you might want to break up your draft: maybe you start with brainstorming a main claim, or maybe you start reasoning through some evidence.</p>

        <h3>Get to the End</h3>
        <p>How do you know when you're done with a first draft? When you get to the end of your page limit or you feel like you're done substantiating your argument. Finishing a first draft is a huge accomplishment, so sometimes just buckling down and getting to the end is a wonderful goal.</p>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p>Research by Robert Boice shows that writers are most successful — they produce the most pages — when they write in short, regular chunks of time every day. Even as little as 30 minutes a day can make a real difference.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3: Revision -->
    <div class="guide-section">
        <hr class="hairline">
        <h2>Revision</h2>

        <h3>Revise Your Main Claim</h3>
        <p>If you started with your introduction, chances are the main claim you have there isn't the strongest version. We often learn a lot about our argument — what we want to say, how we want to say it — as we keep writing. It can be useful to look for other places (like a conclusion) where the main claim might be stronger. Try revising your main claim to make it more specific.</p>

        <h3>Analyze Your Argumentation</h3>
        <p>Do any of your paragraphs summarize or describe the evidence rather than analyze it? Is each claim grounded in a specific piece of textual evidence that's cited? Do you reason through your evidence so your readers know what to look for? These types of questions can help strengthen your argumentation or close reading.</p>

        <h3>Reverse Outline Your Argument</h3>
        <p>Reverse outlining takes an essay and examines it in skeletal form: the <strong>main claim</strong> (thesis statement), the <strong>point</strong> of each body paragraph, and the <strong>function</strong> that the body paragraph serves in advancing your argument.</p>
        <p>Reverse outlines tell us a lot about how to improve our arguments. Are the points in each paragraph the same? Is the function of a paragraph unclear? Does one point mostly deal with something obvious? By asking yourself these questions, you can begin to decide which points best serve your argument, which might be repetitive, and which might not need space in your paper.</p>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p>If your most interesting point doesn't appear until page three of a five-page paper, consider what purpose the earlier pages serve. Could that compelling paragraph be a starting place rather than a middle or ending place?</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 4: Final Polishing -->
    <div class="guide-section">
        <hr class="hairline">
        <h2>Final Polishing</h2>

        <h3>Double Check Your Citations</h3>
        <p>Use a resource like Purdue OWL to double check your citations and make sure that each piece of evidence is properly cited and that you have a works cited page. Citation formatting can be tedious, but getting it right is an important part of presenting your work professionally.</p>

        <h3>Swap Your Paper with a Friend</h3>
        <p>Working with a friend can be useful at any stage of the writing process, but it's especially helpful at the end. A friend can catch smaller grammar and spelling mistakes that you might have missed, ask for clarification if they're confused, and more. They are your real-life readers, so you can test out your ideas on them and see how they come across on the page.</p>
